"""Tool-tier classification: core vs capability-skill-gated.

Problem this module solves
--------------------------
Before this refactor every TOOL_DEFINITIONS entry was sent to every
agent's LLM regardless of what the agent was supposed to do. A fresh
meeting turn burned ~22k input tokens, most of it tool schemas the
agent would never call. User observation: "项目管理 那 5 个工具没授
权给 agent 啊" — confirmed: no gating layer existed.

Design
------
Three tiers, enforced by ``filter_tools_by_capability``:

  CORE                     always shipped to every agent's LLM
                           (agent identity / basic filesystem / web /
                            memory / scheduler / MCP bridge). Hardcoded.

  GLOBAL DEFAULT CAPS      admin-editable list of capability skills that
                           every agent gets implicitly. Admins set this
                           in ~/.tudou_claw/capability_defaults.json or
                           via Portal UI.

  PER-AGENT GRANTS         ``agent.granted_skills``. Extra capabilities
                           on top of the global defaults for this
                           specific agent.

Effective capabilities for an agent = GLOBAL_DEFAULTS ∪ granted_skills.
A tool ships iff it is CORE or its gating capability is in that set.

Why the two-layer (global + per-agent) split
--------------------------------------------
Without a global layer admins would have to toggle the same capability
on every single agent one-by-one. Without a per-agent layer the
one-off "only my PM agent should have project-management" cases
become impossible. Both knobs make sense; this module exposes both.

Why not map to existing workflow skill IDs
------------------------------------------
Workflow skills ("test-driven-development", "brainstorming") are
methodology docs, not capability unlocks — agents follow them but
don't gain new tools from granting them. Capability skills are a
different concept: granting them unlocks a bundle of TOOL_DEFINITIONS
entries. We use dedicated names to keep the two kinds separate.

Exception: `pptx-author` already exists AS a workflow skill AND would
be the natural capability-skill name for the two pptx tools. Reusing
is fine since the semantics line up (granting pptx-author = "this
agent should be able to create pptx"). We accept the overload.

#   web-ops      — search + fetch is basic research capability.
#   memory-ops   — knowledge_lookup + save_experience are L3 learning loop.
#   data-process — datetime_calc / json_process / text_process utilities.
#   ui-visibility — emit_ui_block lets agent render rich UI in chat.
